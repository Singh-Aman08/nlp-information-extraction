## Project Overview

Clinical trial abstracts contain a large amount of unstructured biomedical text, making it difficult for researchers to efficiently extract and compare key study details. This project focuses on converting unstructured clinical trial descriptions into structured information, enabling easier analysis, comparison, and evidence synthesis across studies.

The main objective is to extract structured information from clinical trial abstracts into a predefined schema. Specifically, the task involves identifying and extracting three key components: **Participants (PART)**, **Intervention (INT)**, and **Outcome (OUT)** from each abstract. The extracted information is then used to evaluate and compare different information extraction strategies.

The dataset used in this work is the **EBM-NLP dataset**, which consists of annotated clinical trial abstracts along with a structured schema for information extraction. This dataset provides the foundation for training and evaluating multiple approaches, including rule-based methods, statistical models, and large language model-based techniques.

The project systematically compares the effectiveness of different extraction strategies, ranging from traditional rule-based approaches to modern transformer-based and fine-tuned language models, to assess their ability to accurately structure biomedical information from unstructured text.
